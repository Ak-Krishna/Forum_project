# Forum_project
I have created a forum project like a actual forum ,I had keep a login and signup functionality in it. if someone want to contribute in forum without any login then he/she can't get access , they can see all the thing but can't contribute in it without login. 
they can't go through singup/login proccess and after successful login they can contribute in forum they can add there question they can give the answer of the question,they can put they comments on answer etc
